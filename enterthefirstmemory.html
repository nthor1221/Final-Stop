                The scene rises around you, displacing the Styx. You stand in a dimly lit kitchen. A younger version of yourself sits at a table, poring over a stack of bills. Across the room, a woman stands with arms crossed, frustration etched into her face.  
            </p>
<p class="wife">"You're always here, but you're never really here,” she says. “Do you even care anymore?”</p>

<p>Your younger self doesn't look up. His voice is low, tired.  

    "You know I'm working all the time, I can't be the caregiver. Someone has to keep the lights on." 
    
    The words hang in the air like smoke, choking and bitter.  </p>
            <p class="charon">"She knew you were lying every time. You always took on those hours to get on good terms with that lovely supervisor of yours."</p>
