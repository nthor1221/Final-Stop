                You turn away from the light. Charon doesn't speak, but his silence says everything. He understands. The boat drifts slowly, away from the warmth of the light, into a place that feels colder, more unforgiving
            </p>
            <p>The Styx darkens even more, the waters now turbulent, crashing against the sides of the boat. There is no peace here. Only the endless ripple of unresolved pain. </p>
