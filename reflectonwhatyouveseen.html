                The boat comes to a stop. The water around you ripples with an unnatural stillness. You turn to Charon, who has an unreadable expression. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly, he looks directly at you.
            </p>
            <p class="charon">"It's time for you to decide if you'll pass, but I guess you're just a passenger now, there's another person making the decisions."</p>
            <p class="charon">"YOU. You've seen his flaws, his guilt, his attempt at redemption. And now, here you are, standing at the edge. Do you want him to move on? Or do you think he should stay and continue his struggle, lingering in his own memories?"</p>
            <p>Charon leans forward, his eyes piercing.</p>
            <p class="charon">"I'm here to make you see him for what he is. You have a choice. You always did. What happens to him is yours to decide"</p>
