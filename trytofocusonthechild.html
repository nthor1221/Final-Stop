                You lean closer, the ripples spreading outward as if the water itself resists your gaze.  

The child becomes clearer—a small, frail figure clutching a stuffed rabbit. Their lips tremble as they whisper:  
            </p>
            <p class="daughter">"Why doesn't he want me? Did I do something wrong?"</p>
            <p>The words pierce through you like a knife. You try to speak, but your voice won't come.  

                The image shatters, replaced by your fractured reflection. You feel a numbing cold wash over you as the whispers quiet to reveal a disconcerting silence.</p>

            <p class="charon">""Children see truth where we hide it. But don't fret—you'll find more of yourself in the depths"."</p>
