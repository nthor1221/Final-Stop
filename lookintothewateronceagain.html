                You're standing in front of an ATM store, holding a receipt. The date and time feel familiarâ€”too familiar.  
            </p>
            <p>The younger version of yourself emerges from the store, stuffing a wad of cash into his pocket. His face is pale, eyes devoid of life.</p>

            <p class="charon">"A divorce settlement. That's what this was, wasn't it? The cost of walking away."</p>
