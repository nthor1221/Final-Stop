                The water shifts again, pulling you into another memory. This time, the room is brighter—a job interview. A younger version of yourself sits across from a man in a suit.  
            </p>
            <p class="employer">"This position is demanding,” the man says. "But it pays well. You'll be able to provide for your family. Think about the future.”</p>
            <p>The younger you nods, clutching a resume in sweaty hands.  
                But something feels off—a faint tug, like a voice unheard.  </p>
            <p class="charon">"Every choice opens a door, and closes another."</p>
