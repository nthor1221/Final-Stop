                You lean closer, hoping to decipher something from the empty void.

Among the shards, a memory emerges:  
You recognize yourself, standing in the factory. You grip your phone tightly, your face strained in anger. Your harsh tone startles even yourself.

"Why do you always have to question me when I have to work late? You expect too much of me, get off my back!"</p>
<p>The other voice is shrill, desperate.</p> 
<p class="wife">"This is the third time this week, we need you home! I need you. Please..."</p>
<p>The reflection suddenly distorts, the scene swallowed by rippling waves.  </p>
