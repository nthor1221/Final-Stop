                Charon leans back, watching you quietly as the boat drifts, caught between two currents. The light is distant now, but something lingers—a feeling of something unfinished. 
            </p>
            <p class="charon">"You've let him go—but only partly"</p>
            <p>The waters around the boat stir gently, as if reflecting the indecision that lingers.</p>
            <p class="charon">"He'll carry the memories, the faces of those he loved and failed, with him into whatever comes next. It's not a perfect ending, but is there ever such a thing?"</p>
