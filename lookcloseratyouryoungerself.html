                You step closer to the man at the table—yourself, but not the version you want to remember. The lines of worry etched on his face feel familiar, but his eyes are hollow.  
            </p>
            <p class="wife">“We don't need more hours. We need you.”</p>
            <p>The younger you finally looks up, but his expression is unreadable.  

                The scene fractures, dissolving into ripples that draw you back to the boat.  </p>
